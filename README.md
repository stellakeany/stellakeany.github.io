# Personal website

This is the first version of my personal website to be published online, however this is not its first iteration. I initially started this project as a way to play around with using Bootstrap and other libraries, but halfway through I decided I would rather see how far I could go just using vanilla CSS and JavaScript.

I am not 100% happy with this website just yet, but I feel like it is better for me to publish it now when it is an ok state than wait until I am 100% happy with it which could be in another 5 years time. I will continue to work on it when I have the time.

## Current bugs/other things that need to be fixed
- Implement mobile/small screen view
- Bug in typewriter function when tabs are switched between quickly
- Implement staggered fade in function for timeline animation as originally intended
- Hide overflow of scrollbar properly

### Possible addditional features
- Include functionality for search bar, refresh button etc
- Improve styling
